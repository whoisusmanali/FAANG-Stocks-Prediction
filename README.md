# Time Series Forecasting and Analysis with Streamlit

This project is a web application built using **Streamlit** that provides robust tools for time series forecasting, analysis, and performance enhancement. The application leverages advanced deep learning models to deliver accurate forecasting results while integrating key functionalities such as data cleaning, validation, and performance optimization. In this project, I have focused on predicting the stock values of leading technology and consumer-focused companies, specifically FAANG companies (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Google) and Microsoft.

## Features

### 1. **Time Series Forecasting**
- Utilizes deep learning models for precise and scalable forecasting.
- Provides predictions with visualizations to assist in decision-making.

### 2. **Data Cleaning and Validation**
- Automatically detects and handles missing or inconsistent data.
- Ensures input data quality through thorough validation steps.

### 3. **Performance Enhancement**
- Optimizes forecasting model performance using advanced techniques.
- Fine-tunes model parameters for improved accuracy.

### 4. **Data Analysis**
- Offers in-depth analysis of time series data.
- Generates insights through descriptive statistics and graphical representations.

## Technologies Used

- **Streamlit**: For building the interactive web interface.
- **Python**: The primary programming language.
- **Deep Learning Frameworks**: TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch for implementing forecasting models.
- **Data Manipulation**: Pandas and NumPy for handling datasets.
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly for generating plots.

## How to Run the Application

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd time-series-forecasting
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```
5. Access the application in your web browser at `http://localhost:8501`.

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Upload**:
   - Upload your time series dataset (CSV format).
   - Preview the uploaded data.

2. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Clean the dataset using automated tools within the application.
   - Handle missing or erroneous values.

3. **Analysis and Visualization**:
   - Explore the data through summary statistics and customizable visualizations.

4. **Model Training and Forecasting**:
   - Train the deep learning model on the cleaned dataset.
   - Generate forecasts for the desired time horizon.

5. **Performance Metrics**:
   - Evaluate model performance using metrics like MSE, RMSE, and MAE.
   - Fine-tune the model to improve results.

## Screenshots
